    I began my coding journey 5 years ago and for the last 2 have been comitted myself to learning blockchain technologies.
    
    I have considerable experience with React, Typescript and multiple databases, which has become my stack of choice for most web applications.

    I also have experience with solidity and have deployed dozens of smart contracts fpr ethereum/polygon.

    I was born in Johannesburg and started my career in corporate being both an anlyst and manager, I moved to Europe when I was 23 and have been living in Amsterdam for the last 5 years and it has been the city where my love for coding blossomed.

    Through my career I have dabbled with several avenues of programming including data gathering, data science, and automation, though nothing has satisfied me quite like designing, developing and deploying web applications.

    Socrates emphasized the need for critical self-examination and the pursuit of knowledge. This is how I approach my life and my work, I am always looking to improve and challenge myself.
